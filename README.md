## What did you make the graphs with?
Most of these are made with RStudio but I also used Canva and Photoshop.
## Midterm Data Visualization: Personal Data
### What data did you record?
The hours of sleep I got per night, number of steps per day, and ounces of water consumed per day.
### What kind of graphs did you make?
Primarily bar graphs because making anything else in R studio twists a particularly prickly thorn in my side, but I initially made an incorrect pie graph.<br>

The above are okay by themselves but a visualization should be able to be a stand alone thing where you can glean as much information as possible by looking at it. They need to be easy to read, and actually correct graphs that don't mislead/misinform/confuscate the information or the reader. An example of this is the idea of correlation is not causation. If there's a positive correlation between violence and video games, that doesn't mean video games are the cause of violence.<br>

## Midterm Report
I'll be honest, I wasn't surprised by these results. When the semester gets going, the amount of sleep and steps I get decreases by a lot. This was a session A class--only from August-October--and I didn't continue to record the data after the class was done. So, not really but I think it's cool to see.
## Final Data Visualization: Nintendo
### What data did you record and where did you get it?
Originally, I was going to do something food-related because I'm a huge foodie and something about the food industry piqued my interest. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any good data sets to go along with it, so I went for video games, specifically Nintendo. I was curious how they chose what kinds of games they chose to make, and ultimately what makes a "good" Nintendo game, and if longer games were better. Here is the data for sales and here is the data for how long it took to beat the games.
### What kind of graphs did you made?
I made several versions of the graphs in the final version.<br>

An unused line graph for the Sales of Nintendo around the world<br>
The above is a cool graph but as you can see, it's hard to read. So it didn't make the cut. I decided on a hot pink theme because when I researched "gamer aesthetic" it's hot pink and I chose a color palette to have colors to go with that.

A bar graph showing sales by year in North America<br> 
For the above, I tried to narrow it down to North America hoping my data wouldn't be so large. I was wrong, and it's still difficult to read.<br>

Early version for time to beat a Nintendo game<br>
The above is close as it tells you the overall time and tells you what most of the peaks are but still not quite there. You as a viewer, probably care about all the peaks, since you probably like video games, but the bars are still super close together and it looks congested overall.

## Final Thoughts:
Honestly, my data visualization class was super fun even if it took me quite awhile to do the assignments. It's a good mixture of data, logic, and creativity which is amazing.
